# Truss_analysis
It takes input accordingly as mentioned:
First it takes N(no of nodes), E and Area of cross section as input.
Then it takes the Nodes matrix, the Adjacency matrix and then the Constraint and external load matrices as inputs.
It gives output of the initial truss and the deformed truss as well as the plot of how the deformed truss will look like.
It gives the member forces, the Reaction forces and lastly the displacements of all the nodes.
The code works on the principle of FEM by calculating the stiffness matrix
